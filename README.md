      <p style="margin: 0;"><b> The predictive power of social media. Since social media is a fine place where people exchange thoughts, views, ideas and discuss them, to know how impactful these discussions really are and how it affects our day to day lives. Created several predictive and learning models such as regression, classification, time series forecasting, neural networks and LSTM (long short-term memory) trained on Tweets that are obtained from Twitter using the data extraction methods. We will be using the tweets related to two of the most popular crypto currency, DogeCoin and Bitcoin, and on the basis of the learning that model retains, predict the surge and depletion in the value of cryptocurrencies.</b><br>
